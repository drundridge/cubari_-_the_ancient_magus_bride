  "description": "With her mother dead and father long gone, Chise Hatori has spent her childhood being passed unwanted from relative to relative,\nuntil she finally makes her unfortunate way to a strange and improbable auction block.\n\nOffered as a “Slay Vega” to the highest bidder, Chise is purchased by the (literally) boneheaded Elias Ainsworth,\nwho promises to take her on as his apprentice.\n\nElias is a mage, and his world is one of dragons and faeries - but before Chise can begin to get accustomed to all of this,\nElias drops another bombshell. Apparently Chise isn't just intended to be his apprentice - she will also be his bride.",
